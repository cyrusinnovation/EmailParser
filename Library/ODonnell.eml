This week in NYC innovation

Where Brooklyn at?

I've said that it probably wouldn't happen=2C but it did.  A big startup m=
oved to Brooklyn.

Livestream just moved its entire operation (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05=
/23/nyregion/in-search-of-space-and-creativity-a-start-up-is-headed-to-bro=
oklyn.html?_r=3D0)  and 80 employees over to the old 3rd Ward space in Bus=
hwick.  I had previously thought that the big Brooklyn companies would all=
 be homegrown--that unless you started out with an employee base that was=
 small=2C and grew it locally=2C you probably wouldn't see such a move.  I=
 guess when they're asking a third the rent you find in Chelsea and half y=
our employee base lives in Brooklyn anyway the move seems pretty compellin=
g.

To celebrate=2C let's all go to a ball game!

Actually=2C I had this in the works before=2C but the more the merrier.  O=
n July 17th=2C the Brooklyn Cyclones--the Mets minor league affiliate in C=
oney Island--are holding a tech & startups night (http://cyclonesandstartu=
ps.eventbrite.com) .  We're getting 100's of people out to the ballpark=2C=
 which is a fantastic place to watch a game.  It's right on the boardwalk=
 and the beach.  When's the last time you paid $17 to go watch a ball game=
=2E  We'll have lots of employees from companies like Huge=2C Makerbot=2C To=
ugh Mudder=2C Etsy=2C etc.=2C but tickets have already been selling fast.=
  Looks like we'll get at least 500 out to the game.  If you live and/or w=
ork in Brooklyn=2C or just want to see baseball without paying hundreds of=
 dollars=2C come join us by RSVPing here. (http://cyclonesandstartups.even=
tbrite.com)   If you want to get your entire company out to the ballpark f=
or this=2C just reply and we'll think about doing something cool.

_____

Speaking of expanding locations=2C there's a new WeWork Labs location at 7=
9 Madison Ave.  They would like to personally invite you and your startup=
 in for a tour. Because they love the NY tech community=2C they're offerin=
g to waive the WeWork setup fees and to give you 20% off of your first mon=
th! Send an email to joinus@wework.com with the subject line "NoMad-CEONYC=
" to get started.

_____

I've got two really compelling technical opportunities to work in the crea=
tivity and kids space with some fantastic founders.

The first is a company that turns kids art into lasting keepsakes.  Imagin=
e all the things you drew when you were three being saved in a series of c=
offee table books or posters=2C instead of yellowing away in a box somewhe=
re.  The company works with schools and was founded by two moms--a former=
 publisher and a former equities trader.  They've done some serious revenu=
e with an outsourced tech product and are looking in house to build out a=
 technical team with some ecommerce experience.  Anyone who has worked wit=
h physical logistics like printing and shipping would also be a huge plus.

The second is another curiousity inspiring company--and it promotes physic=
al play and problem solving in real life.  They're creating a distributed=
 network of physical classes=2C so the technology is something similar to=
 what you might find at a company like Mindbody=2C which schedules all the=
 yoga you've ever been to.  Plus=2C there's an educational content compone=
nt which complements the classes--so lots of drip email=2C video and photo=
 distribution=2C etc.

Happy to introduce anyone you or anyone you might know looking to get on b=
oard with something early.  The nice thing here is that these are cashflow=
 generating businesses.  They sell things that people pay for.

____

Hey=2C does anyone want to code up an event bookmarker that can take Meetu=
p and General Assembly Pages and put them in our HTML format for this news=
letter=2C sorting them by date?  So=2C I show up on a page=2C click a book=
marklet=2C and the Date=2C a description=2C location=2C etc just shows up=
 in a database that I can just sort into the right format?  I dunno what t=
he going rate for such things is=2C but I'd pay real cash money for that.

____

Here's another project I'd love to see get built... A private Angel List.=
  I'd like to be able to control who sees what deals I'm looking at=2C and=
 selectively syndicate them out to folks=2C without telling the entire pub=
lic.  It would make finding co-investors a heck of a lot easier.

____

Two classes you should definitely check out for next week.  My friend Jaso=
n's Intro to Product Management Workshop (https://generalassemb.ly/educati=
on/introduction-to-product-management-workshop/new-york-city/5624)  and Ho=
w to Assess Your Product's Market Viability (https://generalassemb.ly/educ=
ation/winner-or-dud-assessing-your-products-market-viability/new-york-city=
/5699) .

____

Also=2C if you care about important stuff=2C like how technology plays a r=
ole in our election process=2C you'll check out this Open Source Democracy=
 event on Wednesday (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-democracy-ti=
ckets-11736876313?aff=3Deiosprexshremail&ref=3Deiosprexshremail) .

____

Do you know who's cool?  My friend Caitlin=2C an investor at Flybridge Cap=
ital.  She's speaking at this event on Thursday (http://www.eventbrite.com=
/e/women-20-city-meetup-new-york-city-tickets-11513022761?aff=3Deorg) .

<p>Where Brooklyn at?</p>
<p>I've said that it probably wouldn't happen=2C but it did. &nbsp;A big s=
tartup moved to Brooklyn. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=3D"http://thisisgoingtobebig.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=
=3D4c2ee8c906b6f9bdf2b29d2b8&id=3D45a207925f&e=3D8404ceda97">Livestream j=
ust moved its entire operation</a>&nbsp;and 80 employees over to the old 3=
rd Ward space in Bushwick. &nbsp;I had previously thought that the big Bro=
oklyn companies would all be homegrown--that unless you started out with a=
n employee base that was small=2C and grew it locally=2C you probably woul=
dn't see such a move. &nbsp;I guess when they're asking a third the rent y=
ou find in Chelsea and half your employee base lives in Brooklyn anyway th=
e move seems pretty compelling.</p>
<p>To celebrate=2C let's all go to a ball game!</p>
<p>Actually=2C I had this in the works before=2C but the more the merrier.=
 &nbsp;On July 17th=2C the Brooklyn Cyclones--the Mets minor league affili=
ate in Coney Island--are holding a <a href=3D"http://thisisgoingtobebig.us=
1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D4c2ee8c906b6f9bdf2b29d2b8&id=3Db92fa7a62=
f&e=3D8404ceda97">tech &amp; startups night</a>. &nbsp;We're getting 100'=
s of people out to the ballpark=2C which is a fantastic place to watch a g=
ame. &nbsp;It's right on the boardwalk and the beach. &nbsp;When's the las=
t time you paid $17 to go watch a ball game. &nbsp;We'll have lots of empl=
oyees from companies like Huge=2C Makerbot=2C Tough Mudder=2C Etsy=2C etc.=
=2C but tickets have already been selling fast. &nbsp;Looks like we'll get=
 at least 500 out to the game. &nbsp;If you live and/or work in Brooklyn=
=2C or just want to see baseball without paying hundreds of dollars=2C <a=
 href=3D"http://thisisgoingtobebig.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D4c2=

VPing here.</a>&nbsp; If you want to get your entire company out to the ba=
llpark for this=2C just reply and we'll think about doing something cool.<=
/p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Speaking of expanding locations=2C there's a new WeWork Labs location a=
t 79 Madison Ave. &nbsp;They would like to personally invite you and your=
 startup in for a tour. Because they love the NY tech community=2C they're=
 offering to waive the WeWork setup fees and to give you 20% off of your f=
irst month! Send an email to joinus@wework.com with the subject line "NoMa=
d-CEONYC" to get started.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>I've got two really compelling technical opportunities to work in the c=
reativity and kids space with some fantastic founders.</p>
<p>The first is a company that turns kids art into lasting keepsakes. &nbs=
p;Imagine all the things you drew when you were three being saved in a ser=
ies of coffee table books or posters=2C instead of yellowing away in a box=
 somewhere. &nbsp;The company works with schools and was founded by two mo=
ms--a former publisher and a former equities trader. &nbsp;They've done so=
me serious revenue with an outsourced tech product and are looking in hous=
e to build out a technical team with some ecommerce experience. &nbsp;Anyo=
ne who has worked with physical logistics like printing and shipping would=
 also be a huge plus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is another curiousity inspiring company--and it promotes phy=
sical play and problem solving in real life. &nbsp;They're creating a dist=
ributed network of physical classes=2C so the technology is something simi=
lar to what you might find at a company like Mindbody=2C which schedules a=
ll the yoga you've ever been to. &nbsp;Plus=2C there's an educational cont=
ent component which complements the classes--so lots of drip email=2C vide=
o and photo distribution=2C etc.</p>
<p>Happy to introduce anyone you or anyone you might know looking to get o=
n board with something early. &nbsp;The nice thing here is that these are=
 cashflow generating businesses. &nbsp;They sell things that people pay fo=
r. &nbsp;</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Hey=2C does anyone want to code up an event bookmarker that can take Me=
etup and General Assembly Pages and put them in our HTML format for this n=
ewsletter=2C sorting them by date? &nbsp;So=2C I show up on a page=2C clic=
k a bookmarklet=2C and the Date=2C a description=2C location=2C etc just s=
hows up in a database that I can just sort into the right format? &nbsp;I=
 dunno what the going rate for such things is=2C but I'd pay real cash mon=
ey for that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Here's another project I'd love to see get built... A private Angel Lis=
t. &nbsp;I'd like to be able to control who sees what deals I'm looking at=
=2C and selectively syndicate them out to folks=2C without telling the ent=
ire public. &nbsp;It would make finding co-investors a heck of a lot easie=
r.</p>
